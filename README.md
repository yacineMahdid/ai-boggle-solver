Boggle is a game played on a 5 by 5 grid of letter where the purpose is to find as many connected words.

A connected words is a sequence of contiguous letter touching in all possible 8 direction forming a word where letters cannot repeat!

There is a time limit for how long you have to find the maximum amount of words (2min). Players get points for every unique word they get compared to the others. The longer the word the more point!

## Problem ‚ùì
The problem we are trying to solve here is to find as many words as possible in a given board game within the time allocated.

It's that "simple"!

## Variant üêª
There is a few variant of the original boggle game which includes:
- different size of square boards
- different time limit

## Current State - Brute Forceü¶ù
Currently here is what the program needs to be run:
- run `./setup.sh` which will download an [english dictionary]((https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_alpha.txt))
- run `python src/main.py BOGGLE_FILE` which will brute force find all the words

the `BOGGLE_FILE` needs to have the same format as the one in the `tests/assets/` folder:
```
n,y,r
n,o,a
o,r,s
```

The runtime for this algorithm is pretty poor right now so don't expect it to be that much useable, the search is not optimized at all.
